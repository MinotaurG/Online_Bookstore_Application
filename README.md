# Online Bookstore Application

## Overview

The Online Bookstore Application is a Java-based web application that simulates a simple e-commerce bookstore. It allows users to search for books, view detailed information, add books to a shopping cart, and proceed through a checkout to place an order. The system also provides personalized recommendations and tracks recently viewed books for each user. All data is persisted in a NoSQL database (Amazon DynamoDB Local), ensuring a flexible schema and easy local development. The application is built with a modern tech stack, focusing on clean design and a responsive user experience.

## Features

### Book Search & Browse
- Users can search for books by title or author keywords and browse a catalog of available books
- Search results are retrieved from a DynamoDB table of books, enabling quick lookups by key or secondary indexes

### Book Details
- Each book has a detail page showing information like title, author, description, price, etc.
- Users can view these details before deciding to purchase

### Shopping Cart
- Users can add books to a virtual cart (with specified quantities)
- The cart is managed in-memory for the session (using Java data structures) and displays all selected items with subtotals
- Users can update quantities or remove items from the cart

### Checkout & Order Placement
- At checkout, the application creates an order for the user
- Order information (including items and total price) is saved to the DynamoDB Orders table
- A confirmation of the successful order placement is provided (simulating a payment flow; actual payment processing is not integrated)

### User Accounts
- The system models user accounts with basic information (username, password, contact info)
- A user can register and log in to maintain a unique cart and order history
- For the demo, a guest user account can be used if registration is not explicitly provided through the UI
- All user data is stored in a DynamoDB Users table for persistence

### Personalized Recommendations
- The application demonstrates personalized book recommendations
- For each user, a set of recommended books (e.g. top 5 picks) is stored in a DynamoDB table and displayed on the user's home page or dashboard
- This feature illustrates integration with DynamoDB for fast retrieval of suggested items

### Recently Viewed Books
- The application keeps track of each user's recently viewed books
- As a user views book details, those titles are added to a "Recently Browsed" list (maintained using a LinkedList in memory)
- Users can easily see their last few viewed items, enhancing the browsing experience
- This feature is for demonstration and resets when the session ends (not persisted to the database)

### Responsive UI
- The web interface is designed with a responsive layout, making the bookstore accessible and user-friendly
- Pages adjust using standard HTML/CSS (and optionally Bootstrap) to ensure a good user experience

## Tech Stack

### Language & Framework
- **Java 17** with **Spring Boot** (Spring MVC) for building the web application and RESTful APIs
- Spring's inversion of control and MVC pattern simplify development and testing

### Database
- **Amazon DynamoDB (Local)** â€“ a NoSQL key-value and document database
- All books, users, orders, and recommendations are stored in DynamoDB tables
- DynamoDB Local is used for development and testing, allowing the application to run offline while emulating the AWS DynamoDB environment

### AWS SDK
- **AWS Java SDK** is used to integrate with DynamoDB
- Domain model classes are annotated with DynamoDB Mapper annotations (e.g., `@DynamoDBTable`, `@DynamoDBHashKey`, etc.), enabling object-relational mapping to DynamoDB items
- Alternatively, the SDK's low-level client is used for certain queries and scans

### Testing
- **JUnit** and **Mockito** for unit tests, ensuring individual components (services, controllers) work correctly
- **Cucumber (BDD)** is used for high-level behavior testing; for example, a feature file defines scenarios for searching a book by title and verifying the results
- Test coverage is measured with **JaCoCo** (about 54% of instructions covered in tests), including both unit and integration tests

### Build & Tools
- **Maven** is used for project management and build
- The project follows standard Maven structure (`src/main/java` for source and `src/test/java` for tests)
- A continuous integration pipeline (**Jenkins**) can be configured to run tests and build the project on every commit
- The Spring Boot Maven plugin or JAR packaging allows easy deployment

### Deployment
- The application is packaged as an executable Spring Boot JAR
- It can be deployed on any machine with Java 17
- For demonstration, it was deployed on a Linux server with DynamoDB Local running
- In production, the DynamoDB endpoint can be switched to AWS DynamoDB service with minimal configuration changes

## Architecture

The Online Bookstore follows a simple **three-tier architecture** with a web-based client, a Java Spring Boot application server, and DynamoDB as the database.

### System Architecture Overview
- The **client** (user's web browser) interacts with the application through HTTP requests (for example, browsing the catalog or submitting an order)
- The **server** (Spring Boot backend) contains controllers to handle these requests, services implementing business logic (like search and checkout), and data access layers for DynamoDB
- The **database** is DynamoDB Local, which the server accesses via AWS SDK calls
- This design decouples the presentation, logic, and data storage layers, making the system modular and scalable

### Data Model

All data persistence is handled by DynamoDB. Each core domain object is stored in its own DynamoDB table:

#### Books Table
- Stores book records
- **Primary key:** Unique Book ID (for example, a UUID or ISBN)
- **Attributes:** title, author, price, genre, description, and inventory stock count
- Can be queried by primary key
- For search by title/author, the application either performs a scan (for demo scale) or utilizes a Global Secondary Index on those attributes

#### Users Table
- Stores user account information
- **Primary key:** Unique User ID or username
- **Attributes:** name, email, password hash
- Used to authenticate users (login) and to retrieve user details (e.g., when placing an order)

#### Orders Table
- Stores orders placed by users
- **Primary key:** Order ID (unique identifier for each order)
- **Attributes:** 
  - Associated User ID (to indicate who placed it)
  - List of purchased books (each with quantity)
  - Timestamp/date
  - Total amount
- A single item per order is used, with a list or map attribute to detail the items and quantities
- This eliminates the need for joins, since all relevant order info is encapsulated in one record

#### Recommendations Table
- Stores recommended books per user
- **Primary key:** User ID
- **Attributes:** List of Book IDs (or titles) recommended for that user
- On a user's home page or after login, the application fetches the recommendations from this table and then retrieves those books' details from the Books table to display
- This is a denormalized design aimed at quick lookup of personalized suggestions

#### Shopping Cart (In-Memory Only)
- The shopping cart is **not persisted** in the database
- Maintained in-memory for each user session (using a Java `HashMap<Book, Integer>` or similar)
- This decision simplifies the implementation: the cart exists only while the user is shopping
- Once the user checks out, an Order is created and saved

### Benefits of NoSQL Design
- **Flexibility:** New attributes can be added to Book or User without migrating schemas
- **Scalability:** DynamoDB can handle high volumes of reads/writes with proper key design
- **Trade-offs:** Complex queries (like filtering or joins) must be handled at the application level or by using indexes

## Installation & Setup

### Prerequisites

1. **Node.js and nvm** installed on your development machine
2. **DynamoDB Local** set up

#### Setting up DynamoDB Local

**JAR Download**
```bash
java -jar DynamoDBLocal.jar -sharedDb
```

*No AWS cloud account is needed; all data will be stored in a local file.*

### Installation Steps

1. **Clone the Repository**
   ```bash
   git clone <repository-url>
   cd Online_Bookstore_Application
   ```

2. **Configure AWS SDK**
   - The application is configured by default to connect to a local DynamoDB on `http://localhost:8000`
   - In the Spring Boot `application.properties` (or YAML), the endpoint for DynamoDB is set accordingly
   - Set AWS access keys as environment variables (dummy values for local connection):
     ```bash
     export AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID=dummy
     export AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY=dummy
     ```

3. **Install Dependencies**
   ```bash
   npm install
